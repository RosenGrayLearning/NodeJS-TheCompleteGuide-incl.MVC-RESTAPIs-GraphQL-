RestApi - Stateless,client-independent API for exchanging data
GraphQL Api - Stateless,client-independent API for exchanging data
              with higher query flexibility 

- RestApi Limitations
1. GET/post -> get the post object (id,title,content...) - but we need only title
2. solution might be - creating another end point : GET/post-title
3. solution might be - taking the entire post and filter it on the front side of our app
4. solution might be - adding query params GET /post?data=title
5. the problem : we will have a lot of end points, which we will have update 
   them all the time, and this solution is not flexible

solution : GraphQL
