***************************** WebSockets *****************************

- a protocol - instead of http
- alow us to build real time web services - real time communication 
- what if something changes on the server, and we want to inform the client 
  for example : email being sent or incoming chat message.
- we wont have to send a response to get it back, the server will let us 
  know as soon as it has some update for us

Http - client request --> server response client
WebSockets - server pushes data to client
